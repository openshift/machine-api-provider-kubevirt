# OpenShift cluster-api-provider-kubevirt 

This repository hosts an implementation of a provider for KubeVirt for the
OpenShift [machine-api](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-api).

This provider runs as a machine-controller deployed by the
[machine-api-operator](https://github.com/openshift/machine-api-operator)

## Build the code

1. If needed run `make generate` to re-generate auto generated files

1. If needed, run `make vendor` to sync all imports in go.mod file and in vendor directory

1. To build the project, run `make build`

## Create and deploy image

TODO

## Test locally built KubeVirt actuator

1. **Prepare The Openshift Cluster**

   Two options:
   1. Use Openshift cluster\
      In order to be able remove `machine-controller` container from `machine-api-controllers` deployment, need to remove `machine-api-operator` and `openshift-cluster-version` pods from the cluster, by decresing their replicacount in the deployments to zero:
      ```sh
      oc scale --replicas 0 -n openshift-cluster-version deployments/cluster-version-operator\
      oc scale --replicas 0 -n openshift-machine-api deployments/machine-api-operator\
      ```
   2. Use CRC cluster

      Create CRC cluster, using the following instructions:\
      https://code-ready.github.io/crc/#introducing-codeready-containers_gsg\
      - Increase the default memory size provided by CRC (at list 20 Gib)
      - Use CRC in remote machine, not your private machine, use the following instructions for remote access:\
        https://www.openshift.com/blog/accessing-codeready-containers-on-a-remote-server/

      In the CRC, several operators have been disabled to lower the resource usage, `machine-api-operator` and `openshift-cluster-version` are among those operator, therefore, in order to deploy `machine-api-controllers` in the cluster, run `machine-api-operator` locally on your machine, using the instructions under:\
      https://github.com/openshift/machine-api-operator#dev

1. **Tear down machine-controller**

   Deployed machine API plane (`machine-api-controllers` deployment) is (among other
   controllers) running `machine-controller`.\
   In order to run locally built one, simply edit `machine-api-controllers` deployment and remove `machine-controller` container from it.

1. **Deploy secret with the infra-cluster kubeconfig**

   KubeVirt actuator assumes existence of a secret created from kubeconfig file.\
   If needed, generate the secret using the following command:
   ```sh
   oc -n openshift-machine-api create secret generic infracluster-kubeconfig-config --from-file=kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG
   ```

1. **Create PVC template**

   KubeVirt actuator assumes existence of a pvc template.\
   If needed, generate it using the following command:
   ```sh
   oc create -f examples/pvc-from-url-rhcos.yaml
   ```

1. **Build and run KubeVirt actuator outside of the cluster**

   ```sh
   $ make build
   ```

   ```sh
   $ ./bin/machine-controller-manager --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG --logtostderr -v 5 -alsologtostderr
   ```
